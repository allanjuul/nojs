no.js 
=====

a javascript framework doing nothing



background 
==========

client javascript is fine when the frontend user gets a better user experience.
but, many many times a frontend user actually gets a worse experience when javascript 
is splattered all over a web page. look around, turn off javascript and judge.



statement
=========

the sole purpose of using no.js is to make a silent, but public statement.

by using this framework you agree that the world doesn't necessarily need more javascript
but probably less.



size
====

original size is zero bytes. don't be fooled â€“ your clients still have to http fetch those
zero bytes.

there is currently no minified version, sorry.


usage
=====

<script src="no.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
